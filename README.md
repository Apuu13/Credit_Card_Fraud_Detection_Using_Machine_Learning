# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Using_Machine_Learning

Summary :- The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem involves building a
machine learning model that learns from historical credit card
transactions, particularly those that were identified as fraudulent. This
model is then applied to new transactions to determine if they are
fraudulent or not. Various technologies and libraries can be used for this
task, such as Python programming language and its popular libraries like
scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. These libraries provide powerful
machine learning algorithms and tools for data preprocessing, feature
engineering, and model evaluation, enabling effective detection of
fraudulent credit card transactions
